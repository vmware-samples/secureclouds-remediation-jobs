# Enable S3 Access Logging

This job enables Access Logging for an S3 Bucket. It checks for a target bucket with name "vss-logging-target-{cloud_account_id}-{region}", if the bucket exists then it gives log delivery permissions to that bucket and then stores the logs into it. If the bucket does not exist then it creates one.

## Running the tests
You may run test using following command under vss-remediation-worker-job-code-python directory:
```shell script
    python3 -m pytest test
```

## Deployment
1. Provision a Virtual Machine
Create an EC2 instance to use for the worker. The minimum required specifications are 128 MB memory and 1/2 Core CPU.
2. Setup Docker
Install Docker on the newly provisioned EC2 instance. You can refer to the [docs here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html) for more information.
3. Deploy the worker image
SSH into the EC2 instance and run the command below to deploy the worker image:
```shell script
  docker run --rm -it --name worker \
  -e VSS_CLIENT_ID={ENTER CLIENT ID}
  -e VSS_CLIENT_SECRET={ENTER CLIENT SECRET} \
  vmware/vss-remediation-worker:latest-python
