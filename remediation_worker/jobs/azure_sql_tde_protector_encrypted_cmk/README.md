# Encrypt SQL Server TDE protector with CMK

This job encrypts SQL Server TDE protector with Customer Managed Keys. It checks for the existence of the Key Vault created by CHSS in a give resource group and region, if the Key Vault exists then it creates a new Key in it and then encrypts the SQL Server TDE protector. If the Key Vault does not exists then it creates one.

The Key Vault created by CHSS is prefixed with "chss" and is tagged by `{"Created By" : "CHSS"}`.
