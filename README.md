## Abstract
These jobs represent open-sourced remediation jobs to be used in conjunction with the
[Secure State remediation worker for python](https://hub.docker.com/r/vmware/vss-remediation-worker). In order
to make use of this code, you must utilize the worker and have a Secure State worker group properly set up.

## Quick Start Guide
There are a couple conventions that must be followed in order to contribute working jobs to this repository:
* The directory structure and
* The file names

Each job must be entire self-contained within a directory, which is where the job gets its name from.
For example, a directory by the name of `s3-remove-public-access` will result in a job
called `s3-remove-public-access`

In order to execute a python job, the file must be named the same as the directory with a `.py` extension.
For example, the job `s3-remove-public-access` must have a `s3-remove-publc-access.py` file within that directory.

The `requirements.txt` file and the `constraints.txt` file are optional but recommended. This ensures
the worker can install the requirements in a repeatable fashion, which ensures the Secure State
application will not invalidate jobs due to new requirements being installed.

## Job execution
When the worker runs, all requirements found in the (optional) `requirements.txt` and `constraints.txt` files will be installed relative to the job
directory. When the job is executed, the python runtime is restricted to the requirements in that relative path.
This ensures all code being executed is known to the Secure State worker and can be verified
via checksum. The worker also moves the entire folder to a separate working directory to
ensure local imports will not work.

The worker executes jobs in a fashion similar to running `python ./s3-remove-publc-access/s3-remove-publc-access.py {... finding payload json ...}`

The finding payload is in the form:
```$json
{
  "notificationInfo": {
    "CloudAccountID" : <string>,
    "RuleID": <string>,
    "RuleName": <string>,
    "RuleDisplayName": <string>,
    "Level": <string>,
    "Service": <string>,
    "FindingInfo": {
      "FindingId": <string>,
      "ObjectId": <string>,
      "ObjectChain": <string>,
      "CloudTags": {
        "<key1>": "<value1>",
        "<key2>": "<value2>",
      },
      "RiskScore": <integer>,
      "Region": <string>,
      "Service": <string>
    }
  },
  "autoRemediate": <boolean>
}
```

## Logging
All stdout and stderr logs are sent to the Secure State web application for display in the
user interface. Take care when logging and make sure not to log sensitive data.

## Supported Remediation Jobs
The table below lists all the supported jobs with their links.
